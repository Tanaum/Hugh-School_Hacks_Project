                <h1>What Is The Issue?</h1>
                <p>You may be wondering that all of this climate change and global warming is something that people should not worry about since it is natural for the Earth to warm up. We wish that this was right, unfortunately, the data shows otherwise. Places that had never recieved any snowfall had to suffer due to it; summers are hotter than usual (there's a heat wave going on in several countries such as the UK and India). The ozone layer has been depleting due the harmful gases released from factories. Those same gases also contribute to acid rain!</p>
